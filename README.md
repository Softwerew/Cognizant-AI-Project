# Cognizant-Virtual AI-Project

So we have been given the customer sales data of Gala Sales Groceries and we have to help them with a supply-chain issue. So  I have done some data pre-processing and performed some EDA on the data. The findings are below:

 	The dataset has 7829 rows and 10 columns
 	The data is for the first 7 days of March,2022
 	We can say that fruits and vegetables are sold in most quantities.
 	We observe that Gold customers use e-wallet more than other payment types. whereas standard and premium customers mostly using cash. Credit card and debit card are used across all customer types. Overall we can say that all 4 kinds of payment types are used on a great scale across all customer types.
 	High correlation exists between unit price and total amount.
 	However, the main question of the client is “How to better stock the items that they sell?” From this dataset, it is impossible to answer that question. Now we have only some vague statistics which can in no way be able to give us the answer we are looking at as the data sample is from 1 store and 1 week worth of data.



Hence it is clear that:
 	We need more rows of data.
 	Since the current business problem is too broad, we have to narrow down the focus in order to deliver a valuable end product.
 	We need more features. Based on the problem statement that we move forward with, we need more columns (features) like 'stocks at the beginning of the day', 'stocks at the end of the day', 'returned item count(if any) at the end of the day’, ‘category-wise self-life', just to name a few, that might help us to address the specific problem and understand the outcome that we're solving for.
